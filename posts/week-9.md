## 1. Discussion

**Consider I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS, by Lauren Lee McCarthy. In what way could you consider this project to:**

**Be an example of mycelial creativity?**

The project is accessible through a website URL, reaching out to a wide range of audiences who own a smartphone (which most people nowadays have), correlating to the Omnidirectional characteristic of *Mycelial creativity*. 

The project utilizes text-to-speech software, delivering the message with a single, unifying voice. This creates a sense of shared experience, evoking the feeling of solidarity among people facing the pandemic's challenges.

It could be transformational by the way people interact with each other in times of pandemic, where face-to-face communication is limited for safety measures. I think the project offers an alternative platform to share experiences and form connections in social distancing. 

**Belong to the aesthetic category of interesting?**

In my opinion, the project belongs to the aesthetic category of interesting because it both has an interesting value and boredom. 

The way the project used the same voice-over tone has a boring value to it. The slowly repeated tone creates a circulation, correlates to Ngai's definition *in the case of interesting, a serial, recursive aesthetic of informational relays and communicative exchange*. It also offers the audience time to process the information while intentionally or unintentionally anticipating for more. 

The interesting value of this project for me is discovering a new communication method in a time of social distancing. The accessibility of the project makes the audience want to participate and share their experiences.

## 2. Brainstorm

**Community of Practice 1:** 

Alternative Photographic Processes students

- Domain: share interested in photographic processes, specifically GLitch aesthetic

- Shared values: finding new ways/ processes to create images without the use of basic lens camera

- Existing repertoire: *glitching*, distorting photographs using a scanner or the use of editing software (Photoshop, Audacity)

- How I might broker this repertoire using creative coding: 
    - Live glitching through the webcam by using face detector (for final in-class exhibition)
    - Creating a platform/ website for students to upload their photo and distort them with Pixel Sorting or other effects

**Community of Practice 2:** 

Family (cousins from 5-7 years old)

- Domain: same background (grow up in the same house), share interested in education

- Shared values: active learning, creating meaningful time together (learning while playing)

- Existing repertoire: watching education show on Youtube together, however, not very effective since it only offers passive learning; doing learning activity together (toy blocks, etc.)

- How I might broker this repertoire using creative coding:
    - Creating interactive website for them to learn about computure
    - Use the webcam to draw on screen
    - Use colour tracking code for the kids to learn about colour while moving around
