## 1. Discussion

**In what ways might the practice of creative coding attend to problems regarding digital infrastructure?**

- Accessibility:

    - Low-cost innovation: Creative coding provides a cost-effective way to make prototypes. Users can explore new ideas and functionalities using accessible and basic languages before large-scale development. 

    - Transparency: Creative coders can utilize open-source tools and materials for their works. This promotes transparency and accessibility regarding digital infrastructure, which broadens awareness and education for digital literacy.

    - Interoperability: By utilizing accessible and open resources, creative coding can have the capacity to run on various software and technologies. This provides interoperability, reaching out to other communities (different cultures, practices, etc.), or widening the community. 

- Digital literacy: 

    - Visibility: By providing a high level of accessibility, creative coding can raise awareness and education about digital infrastructure. People from various backgrounds could learn about the technology not just through higher education but accessible through a simpler and easy to understand form.

    - Sense of belonging: When the digital infrastructure becomes a much friendlier form, people will be encouraged to use and learn about it. This could advocate digital literacy, equipping communities with the skills to develop and maintain their own digital infrastructure solutions, and bridging the gap between communities.

- Decentralization: 

    - With accessibility to open sources, creative coders can develop solutions that are less reliant on centralized control, potentially improving network resilience and accessibility.

    - By advocating digital literacy, creative coding can equip different communities with solutions regarding their own digital infrastructure, addressing specific needs and fostering local ownership of the digital infrastructure.
