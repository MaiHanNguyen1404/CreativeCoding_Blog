# Concept

## The Interesting aesthetic

Through the reading about *Sianne Ngaiâ€™s Zany, Cute, Interesting* by Wark and *Our aesthetic categories* by Sianne Ngai, the Interesting aesthetic, in my opinion, is the combination between interest and boredom. It involves using the boredom to exhibit moments of slowness, stillness to open up a time for audience to think and feel, while anticipate for the slight interested elements.  

The Interesting aesthetic is also about the circulation of information, a serial, recursive aesthetic of informational relays and communicative exchange. It is *the low affect that accompanies the perception of minor differences against a backdrop of the generic, in the case of the interesting* (Ngai 2012). 

I think, to achieve the Interesting aesthetic, is to exhibits the boredom through the circulation of information while also introduce slight bit of interest elements to both creating a moments of slowness and anticipation.

## Ideation

My cousins, who are the core group I focus on as the domain for the Community of Practice, primarily learn about music through passive methods like Youtube songs and shows. While this offers some good content, it lacks interaction for kids and therefore, reduce engagement and their learning efficiency. 

As discussed in the video, my project aims to address this by creating an interactive website. This website will teach musical notes in an engaging way through activities that incorporate body movement.

### Inspirations 

Before starting to work on the project, I did some research on some ways for kids to learn about musical notes through Youtube shows. In these shows (the links below), they often use vibrant color and interesting graphics (cartoon, animation) to illustrate the notes.

[Learn Music w/ Mr. Rob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb1n7BDsNo4&t=506s)

I was particularly interested in these contents (Sound of Music and Sweet Beet Pilot). Instead of just reciting the notes, they assigns a word to each note to create a memory aid. With that inspiration, I also include the emoji of animal that correspond to the start of each note, for example, Do for Dolphin, etc.

## Project Description

*Note Drops*

The website is a game to make the note drop down to the bottom of the screen using interaction with the webcam, to hear the corresponding musical notes.The reflection of the player (my cousins) on the screen will be black and white and the player will try to make white space for the note to drop. 

The screen will act as an invisible virtual piano where player can also press down their cursor to hear the corresponding note along with its name displayed.

# Design Journey

I was inspired by *[this Text Rain (Drawing w Webcam) sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GfKfjgf4cQ&t=460s)* from Patt Vira to understand the way how I should start my work.

</p> 

With that tutorial, I started with setting up the camera and using the threshold value to calculate the position of the notes on the screen (white space means move down, black space means re-calculate and move up to the highest threhold value).
