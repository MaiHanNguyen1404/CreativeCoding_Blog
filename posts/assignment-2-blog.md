# Concepts

## The Chaotic aesthetic

Through the reading about Sianne Ngaiâ€™s Zany, Cute, Interesting by Wark, the Chaotic aestheitc in my opinion, is a performative aesthetic that is anxious and excessive. It involves excessive and sharp implements, an unpredictable imitation - a repetitive flick between the familiar and unfamiliar, continuity and break, *as if trying to copy what someone else does but doing it clumsily* (Wark 2020). 

There's is a sense of instability and unpredictability inside of Chaotic. It works against constraints, trying to break out of their given form. It is a feeling of *flailing helplessness* and frenzy. If the Cute is intimate, domestic, the Chaotic is to be held at a distance. 

I think overall, the Chaotic brings in the randomness (unpredictability), which could enhances the non-redundancy aspect of effective complexity. However, too much chaos tends to disrupt the experience. The key things for Chaotic to increase effective complexity is using their repetitive nature to create a pattern to which the viewer could predict the upcoming elements yet adding a controlled amount of variations for anticipation.

## Inspiration

### Desmond Paul Henry 

For this project, I choose to respond to the works of Desmond Paul Henry.

I was inpsired by the trails of lines and shapes movements in these works. It was not neccessary too excessive or involves sharps elements, however, in my opinion, these works also belong to the Chaotic aesthetic for the unpredictability of movements. They works through the constraintment of shapes, yet maintaining a pattern (with colors, strokes, etc.) which speaks as an effective complexity.

### Internet pop-up ad

For the visual of this project, I took inspiration from these kind of pop-up art from the 'old' internet.

  <img src="/w08/ad2.png" width="45%" height="70px"/>
</p>

These kind of pop-up ad continously appears whenever we mistakenly click on strange website tends to be very frustrating trying to turn them off, however couldn't in a short period of time. I think this coud be use a sharp element for the Chaotic experience. Also, the use of vibrant mixture of colours in these ads could contribute to the Chaotic aesthetic. 

In both the works of Desmond Paul Henry and these ads, there is a similarity with the trails of objects, which I found very interested visually and conceptually (in terms of the Chaotic aesthetic). With Desmond's works, the trails is visually pleasing while the ads is quite upsetting because of their overwhelming presence. Therefore, I want to apply these kind of trails into my work, with the movements of the trails visually pleasing while overwhelm the viewer with their repetitiveness.

## Ideation

*For the Chaotic aesthetic:*

The idea of bombard the viewer with overload of information could be a sharp element for the Chaotic aesthetic and experience. Therefore with this, my concept for the Chaotic aesthetic is using the repetitive overload of demanding, aggressive word 'click' to overwhelm the viewer, while the 'click' action (mouse click) acts as a way to clear the screen.

The appearance of the word trails 'cilck' could be sharp with vibrant colours, while the word appear when click on the canvas could be softer with a neutral colours and a soft tune (audio) accompany. I think this creates a tension between these two elements, which correlate to the working against contraints aspect of the Chaotic experience that I have mentioned above. 

*For the Effective Complexity:*

- Non-redundancy: 
    - The random colours and letters appear in the word trails 
    - The random period of time between each music notes, which later on interact with the second letter traisl (when mouse click)

- Non-randomness: The underlying regurlarity of the same letters within the canvas and same music notes. Also, the colours change in each letter of a trail overall, create a pattern.

# Design Journey

I was inspired by this Floating Typography sketch from Patt Vira to understand the way how I should start my work. ![ams2_process](w08/Typtut.png)

First, I create a class to draw a letter trail root that grows at random speed and direction. At first I put the class in seperate file, however, I think as I was using a lot of 'ctx' variable, the class in seperate file could not get the canvas context. I tried to change the order of the code and adding 'import' and 'export', it still didn't work.

</p>

As I put the class back in the original file, it did work well.
