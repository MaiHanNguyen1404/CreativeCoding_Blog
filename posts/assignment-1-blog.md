## Research and Definition

### The Cute aesthetic:
From this week's reading about Sianne Ngai’s Zany, Cute, Interesting, and some more articles, the definition of ‘cute’ aesthetic, in my opinion, is the desire to become intimate through the act of vulnerability. The cute evokes feeling through its vulnerable, diminutive form and tempting for special care. Its powerlessness can be extremely seductive (Wark 2020). The cute production could be seen as capitalism itself, an obvious example is the Kawaii culture of cuteness in Japan's post-war period through the mass production of toys, manga, and ephemera.

There’s more to cuteness than tempting us for special care. The ‘cute creature can be considered our own gaze’, it’s also our own fantasy to become the ‘cute’, keeping us craving for more. It's giving us the visual language to express our desire through the act of dissolving the distinction between fantasy and reality. The artwork by Julien Ceccaldi from the Cute exhibition below conveys the idea that we are viewing the character through the door gap in the same way that they do, blurring the boundaries between the real and the imaginary. ![asm1_process](w03/artwork.png)
