# Concepts

## Research and Definition

### The Cute aesthetic:
From this week's reading about Sianne Ngai’s Zany, Cute, Interesting, and some more articles, the definition of ‘cute’ aesthetic, in my opinion, is the desire to become intimate through the act of vulnerability. The cute evokes feeling through its vulnerable, diminutive form and tempting for special care. Its powerlessness can be extremely seductive (Wark 2020). The cute production could be seen as capitalism itself, an obvious example is the Kawaii culture of cuteness in Japan's post-war period through the mass production of toys, manga, and ephemera.

There’s more to cuteness than tempting us for special care. The ‘cute creature can be considered our own gaze’, it’s also our own fantasy to become the ‘cute’, keeping us craving for more. It's giving us the visual language to express our desire through the act of dissolving the distinction between fantasy and reality. The artwork by Julien Ceccaldi from the Cute exhibition below conveys the idea that we are viewing the character through the door gap in the same way that they do, blurring the boundaries between the real and the imaginary.

### Effective Complexity:

The Effective Complexity in my opinion is the underlying regularity within a system. It highlights the importance of focusing on the underlying structure rather than just the total amount of data. On top of the underlying regularity, there is a slight sense of randomness in to create the ‘complexity’. However, defining what's "random" and what's a regularity can be subjective. This can lead to variations in how effective complexity is calculated depending on the observer.

In Rafael Rozendaal’s work, there’s always a repeated pattern, a ‘rule’ of how the object interacts within the screen (eg. in *falling falling*, the walls fall repeatedly after one another), however with a few unexpected elements to add in the ‘complexity’ (eg. the random color appears). 

Within the ‘cute’ aesthetic, effective complexity acts as an engagement, an element for the viewer to crave more. If the purpose of the cute is to create a fantasy or a reflection of our gaze, then the effective complexity is to ‘loop’ the fantasy while adding some unexpected elements.
