# Concepts

## Research and Definition

### The Cute aesthetic
From this week's reading about Sianne Ngai’s Zany, Cute, Interesting, and some more articles, the definition of ‘cute’ aesthetic, in my opinion, is the desire to become intimate through the act of vulnerability. The cute evokes feeling through its vulnerable, diminutive form and tempting for special care. Its powerlessness can be extremely seductive (Wark 2020). The cute production could be seen as capitalism itself, an obvious example is the Kawaii culture of cuteness in Japan's post-war period through the mass production of toys, manga, and ephemera.

</p>

There’s more to cuteness than tempting us for special care. The ‘cute creature can be considered our own gaze’, it’s also our own fantasy to become the ‘cute’, keeping us craving for more. It's giving us the visual language to express our desire through the act of dissolving the distinction between fantasy and reality. The artwork by Julien Ceccaldi from the Cute exhibition below conveys the idea that we are viewing the character through the door gap in the same way that they do, blurring the boundaries between the real and the imaginary.

Reading articles: [From emojis to coquettes and Hello Kitty, cute’s transformative potential is shaping how we see ourselves both on and off-screen](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/61895/1/how-cuteness-took-over-the-world-somerset-house-hello-kitty)

### Effective Complexity

The Effective Complexity in my opinion is the underlying regularity within a system. It highlights the importance of focusing on the underlying structure rather than just the total amount of data. On top of the underlying regularity, there is a slight sense of randomness in to create the ‘complexity’. However, defining what's "random" and what's a regularity can be subjective. This can lead to variations in how effective complexity is calculated depending on the observer.

In Rafael Rozendaal’s work, there’s always a repeated pattern, a ‘rule’ of how the object interacts within the screen (eg. in *falling falling*, the walls fall repeatedly after one another), however with a few unexpected elements to add in the ‘complexity’ (eg. the random color appears). 

Within the ‘cute’ aesthetic, effective complexity acts as an engagement, an element for the viewer to crave more. If the purpose of the cute is to create a fantasy or a reflection of our gaze, then the effective complexity is to ‘loop’ the fantasy while adding some unexpected elements.

## Ideation

### Rafael Rozendaal's slick quick
For this assignment, I choose to respond to the work *slick quick* of Rafael Rozendaal.

</p>

I think this work belongs to the aesthetic of 'cute' in the appearance and the movement of the object. The object apppears as a small circle and move within the screen borders, creating a visually pleasing color trails, which could speaks as temptation to maintain in a frame.

For its effective complexity, *slick quick* maintains a 'rule', a regularity, which is the object bouncing across the screen, however with the random color change whenever we press the mouse. 

### My respond
In *slick quick*, I was interested in the constrainment of the circle bouncing and would like to retain that aspect. I think it speaks as a human desire to break out of the 'frame' and escape the reality, which is one of the purpose of the cute aesthetic that I have mentioned above. 

However, I want to answer this *slick quick* piece with a *yes however*, yes it will be constraint in a frame, however, there is an attempt to break free, but whether or not they are successfully escape is depend on the interpretation of the viewer.

For the Cute aspect: I also want to retain the small appearance, while somewhat makes it appears fragile and vulnerable. The powerlessness could shown through having an object actually contraint in a box, however by the appearance of the trails of the box and multiplication of the objects, it will look like the object could escape.

For the Effective Complexity: 
- The underlying regularity: the objects bouncing within the box and change background whenever they touch the edges.
- Slight randomness:
    - Only when the obejct touch the 1 dimension of the box (not always change when touch), which could take a little time to realize
    - Object could be multiply and move at different direction, sometimes they will cross the same path


# Design Journey

I started looking up 3D in p5 since I wanted to have the image of a box. In addition to that, I also learned about orbit control, which allows you to drag and move around the world, along with camera settings. This control, in my opinion, creates interactivity and engagement.
