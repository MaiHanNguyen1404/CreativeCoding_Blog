# Homework

## Grid

First I tried to duplicate the previous code to see what will happen. The result sort of replicate a grid, however, I was not entirely understand the whole process.

My second attempt of making a grid was trying to duplicate the line syntax. The process was easier to understand, however too long and not sufficient. Looking back at the provided code (the code during the lecture), I noticed that there was a lot of conditionals and variables being used, which make the process more efficient and ‘clean’. Therefore, I started to look up some resources to understand better about the variables and conditionals syntax. (Insert Youtube capture).
