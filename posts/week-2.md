# Homework

## Refactor 

For this Refactor exercise, first I watched some tutotials to understand better how Class work. I mostly watched The Coding Train tutorials and practiced alongside with the video. (tut1, tut2)

After some practice, I tried to apply it with the given sketch. However, I was lost at first because I didnâ€™t understand what needed to be put in the class (which properties belongs to the Faller Class). (error_1)

I was really struggle to refactor this given sketch and it keep showing errors. I thought the background color value also belongs to the Faller class, so when I add it to the constructor, it keeps showing that 'rand_col' is not defined (I now realized that it should be defined in the set up function). (color_error)

The next error was it could not access 'faller' before initialization. I think its because I put the conditional If in the constructor and because I did not define a function after closing the constructor. (wrong_class)

In addition to the error, I put in the function that does not belong to the 'faller', therefore, it always show that rand_col is not defined. (function_error)

I had many trials and fails after that, it was until the next class session that I could finally understand what to put in the Faller class. After that, I also recreate the exercise on my own, then adding some code comments. (sketch)
