## 1. Live Coding Performance

[Live Coding Performance](https://youtu.be/zgu9iyWyn9o)

*Frustrating aspect:*

- The problem with having separate devices to control sound and visuals was that we didn't know when to sync them. The visual movement did not sync with the sound, making it quite unsatisfying to watch.

-  Live coding has a rather unexpected result. As my usual approach to coding is usually trial and error, it was quite frustrating trying to produce a specific outcome, showing the 'mistakes' live in the performance.

- Another frustrating aspect when live coding is that we can not save or access our previous sketch. 

*Rewarding aspect:*

- On the other hand, the unexpected outcomes can become exciting moments of discovery for both the performer and the audience.

- With live coding, we could see and contribute to each other process of coding the visual and sound, creating a shared creative process. 

- When the visual and sound of the performance synchronize, it creates a deeply satisfying experience.

## 2. Discussion

*What you think the live-coding community are trying to do, and why?*

Firstly, I think with live coding, the audience can witness the artist's coding process in real-time, and in some cases, even contribute to it. It also introduces a sense of surprise into the performances, which could become an exciting moment of discovery for both the performer and the audience. This fosters a sense of connection and creates a community of shared creative processes. 

Secondly, the harmonious interplay is a key reward of live coding performances. When the visual and sound of the performance synchronize, it creates a deeply satisfying experience. However, the 'mistakes' (not synchronize, unexpected elements) when live I think are also an important aspect of live coding, which is embracing the imperfection.
